# MVC-Intro


Create a simple sqlite db with one table and the following fields:

- Movie
- Rating
- Genre

and populate the fields with some examples.

Then create a MVC based program which allows a user to explore the db so he/she can choose a movie to watch. You may want to allow your user to be able to view the movies sorted by ratings, view movies only over a certain rating etc.
